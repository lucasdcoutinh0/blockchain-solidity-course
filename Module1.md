# Module 1: Short Introduction about Blockchain

## What Is Blockchain
Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology that records and verifies transactions across multiple computers or nodes. It enables secure and transparent data storage and transfer without the need for intermediaries or central authorities. In a blockchain, each transaction is added as a "block" to a chain of previous transactions, forming a chronological and immutable record.

## Key Concepts in Blockchain
1. **Decentralization**: Blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network, where no single entity has control over the entire system. Instead, multiple participants or nodes collectively maintain and validate the blockchain.
2. **Transparency**: The blockchain's ledger is transparent, allowing all participants to view and verify the transactions. Once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring transparency and accountability.
3. **Security**: Blockchain uses cryptographic techniques to secure the data and ensure its integrity. Each block contains a unique cryptographic hash that links it to the previous block, creating a tamper-resistant structure.
4. **Consensus Mechanism**: To agree on the validity of transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain, consensus mechanisms are employed. Popular consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

## Overview of Ethereum blockchain
The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized, public blockchain platform that enables the development and execution of smart contracts. It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 and launched in 2015. Ethereum is designed to go beyond the capabilities of Bitcoin's blockchain by providing a programmable platform for the creation of decentralized applications (DApps).

## Introduction to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It is a sandboxed environment that runs on every node in the Ethereum network and ensures consistency and security across all participants. The EVM executes bytecode instructions, which are generated by compiling smart contracts written in high-level programming languages like Solidity. It allows developers to build complex decentralized applications that can be executed and verified by the network nodes.

## What are smart contracts?
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. They automatically execute predefined actions once the specified conditions are met. Smart contracts run on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, providing trust and transparency in business transactions without the need for intermediaries. These contracts are stored and executed on the blockchain, making them immutable and resistant to censorship.
