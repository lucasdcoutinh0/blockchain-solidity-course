# Control structures: loops and conditionals

## Conditional Statements:

- `if` statement: Allows you to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true.
- `else` statement: Used with an if statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
- `else if` statement: Allows you to check additional conditions if the previous if or else if conditions are false.

## Loops:

- `for` loop: Executes a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times.
- `while` loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- `do-while` loop: Executes a block of code at least once and then repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.

## Control Keywords:

- `break`: Terminates the execution of a loop or a switch statement.
- `continue`: Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
